# Websitey 
Websitey is a Python-based website project creator that automates the setup of basic web development file structures.

It generates the following files:

- `src/index.html`
- `app/app.js`
- `css/style.css`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/sabdelhay/websitey.git

    cd your-new-project

2. Run the `create.py` script:
    chmod +x create.py
   
    ./create.py

    The script will create the project structure in the upper level directory.

## Project Structure
After running the script, you'll have the following structure:

your-project/
├── src/
│   └── index.html
├── app/
│   └── app.js
└── css/
    └── style.css


## Customization
